# University-Management-System

Universities have a large amount of data every year which includes details about the schools which belong to it, the employees, buildings, students and so on. Students enroll for classes, they live in dorms and also make payments and requests which are handled by administrators who also oversee the professors who teach the classes. In order to make data storage and management simple and less time-consuming, an effective university management database system can be a one-stop application for all parties involved in the university.
